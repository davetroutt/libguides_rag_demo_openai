an in-depth understanding of a topic without relying on AI-generated summaries. Also, while generative AI tools can be good at producing generic or formulaic writing (e.g., an email or press release template), they are not good conveying authenticity or uniqueness in writing. Sharing your own original ideas using your own distinctive voice is essential for good writing. If you use generative AI tools in your writing, use them as writing aids rather than substitutes. Finally, always check with your professors to determine whether you can use ChatGPT or similar tools for assistance in completing your research assignments.
