Academic Integrity and Artificial Intelligence (Offered freely by Jill Hogan, Higher Ed Discussions of AI Writing Facebook Group ) Course Policies on Using AI Tools Guidelines shared from Autumn Caines (University of Michigan/College Unbound) and Lance Eaton (College Unbound) Honor code for quizzes and tests (Found on Reddit, r/ChatGPT, January 17, 2023): "I, _________________, used only my notes and the readings for this open-note quiz.

Why did I put that into quotes? Because some of the writing is problematic and a lot of it is downright bland. Having said that, I accept that this is yet another way to get around doing your own work,
