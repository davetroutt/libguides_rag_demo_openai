Welcome to Generative AI
Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) seems to have taken the world by storm. Relying on models that can create new content in the form of text, media, code, and the like, generative AI is used in a variety of globally popular tools such as ChatGPT, Elicit, or Bard. Its unique appeal is linked to its ability to learn the paradigms of its input and use it to generate new information with similar characteristics.
This guide is intended to help students, faculty, and staff at Georgetown University to navigate the quickly evolving terrain of generative AI. It provides an overview of popular AI research tools, offers guidance on crafting prompts in these tools, and points out key library databases and e-books on AI. It also supplies resources related to core AI ethical issues while laying out basic citation rules.
If you require additional assistance, please don't hesitate to  Email a Librarian .
