without the explicit consent of the user. Moreover, certain generative AI policies even permit AI developers to profit off of this personal/sensitive information by selling it to third parties. Even in cases when clear identifying personal information is not entered by AI user, the utilization of the system carries a risk of re-identification as the submitted dataset may contain patterns allowing for the generated information to be linked back to the individual or entity. Given these issues, extensive downloading of Library materials to build AI training corpora is prohibited. Additionally, some Library content providers prohibit any amount of their content being used with AI tools (please see Library's Policy on Responsible Use of Electronic Resources) . Related Recommendations Avoid sharing any personal or sensitive information via the AI-powered tools. Do not download Library materials (i.e., articles, ebooks, infographics, psychographics, or other datasets) into AI as it is prohibited. Always review the privacy policy of the generative AI tools before utilizing them. Be cautious about policies that permit for the inputted data to be freely distributed to third-party vendors and/or other users.
