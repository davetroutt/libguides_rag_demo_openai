offers support and tutorials. Compatibility with Academic Standards Ensure that the tool aligns with academic standards and practices. This is important for citation generators and plagiarism checkers. The tool should be up-to-date with the latest academic guidelines and citation styles. Cost-Effectiveness Evaluate the cost of the tool. While some free ones are available, paid tools often offer advanced or premium features. Consider the value the tool brings to your research process and whether itâ€™s a worthwhile investment. Customization and Flexibility Look for tools that offer flexibility in terms of settings, output formats, and integration with other software e.g. Zotero and MS Office. Data Privacy and Security Given the sensitive nature of research data, choose tools that have strict data privacy and security standards. Difference between Google Scholar and genAI Information Search Google Scholar: is a specialized search engine for links to scholarly articles, conference papers, and patents. It provides an overview of research material reaching back to the mid 20th century. It relies on keyword search and matching, presenting users with a list of relevant academic content. ChatGPT and other genAI employs a conversation-based approach based on probabilistic large language models. Users can pose queries in natural language, and it aims to understand user intent and provide organized responses in complete sentences. User Experience: Google Scholar: While Google Scholar provides comprehensive results, users must filter through search results individually, which can be time-consuming. Some self-citing occurs and citations and impact metrics can be inflated. It's not a 'one-stop-shop' solution and doesn't index every published peer review journal. Full-text access can also be an issue. ChatGPT: offers a user-friendly and intuitive search experience. It understands context and provides human-like answers, saving users time. However it can show hallucinations in it's answers and it does not always use academic appropriate resources to answer questions. Prompt engineering can help get more detailed answers from a LLM.. Fact-Checking and Trust: Google Scholar: Google Scholar focuses on academic content but doesn't fact-check information. The user needs to evaluate their results and be aware of retracted papers and , predatory publishers as well as issues around currency and accuracy and author expertise. ChatGPT: provides straightforward questions and general solutions but falls short in fact-checking tasks. Again the user needs to evaluate their results and be aware of retractions and predatory publishers as well as issues around currency and accuracy and author expertise. In summary, Google Scholar is a specialized source for scholarly content, while ChatGPT offers a conversational search experience useful for summarizing non-specialised general information.
