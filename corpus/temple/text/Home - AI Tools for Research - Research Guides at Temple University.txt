Overview
Temple Libraries is here to support your use of AI-powered features and tools in research and finding information.
We encourage you to test out the many tools available. Our  AI Tools Report Card  assessment rubric suggests questions to ask when you are evaluating AI-powered research tools.
The tools recommended on this guide are either free to Temple users or have some significant free usage tier. Other paid-only tools, and free trial tools without meaningful free access, exist but are not listed here.
SmartSearch database and tool comparison Identify the best places to search based on disciplinary coverage and desired keyword and citation search features. This website is updated regularly with details on major academic databases and tools (including those with AI features) and allows you to build your own custom comparisons. ITHAKA S+R Generative AI Product Tracker From the non-profit higher ed think tank ITHAKA S+R, this Generative AI Product Tracker lists generative AI products that are either marketed specifically towards higher ed faculty or students or are actively used by them for teaching, learning, or research. This list is a living document that is updated regularly. See  this issue brief  for more details.

Temple AI course policy
Students : Temple policy prohibits the use of generative  AI  tools in a class, unless the instructor explicitly grants permission. Temple’s Student Code of Conduct defines unauthorized use of generative AI as academic misconduct (see section C.1.B.5. of the  Student Code of Conduct ). Different instructors may have different rules related to the use of generative AI. Students should read their syllabi carefully to learn what is permitted in a class.
