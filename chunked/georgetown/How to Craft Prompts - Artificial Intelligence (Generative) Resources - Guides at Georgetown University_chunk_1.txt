A prompt is (technically speaking) input to an AI tool. For research AI tools, the prompt is almost always a question, request, or topic posed by you, the human researcher. Why should you try to write good prompts? Good prompts help the AI help you. A well-crafted prompt enables the AI to give you meaningful and useful results. A bad prompt may result in irrelevant data or lead you away from the best research. Good prompts are cheap(er). Many AI research tools charge per task - each search costs you “credits” and (ultimately) money. A good prompt can help you get the desired output without a lot of repeated searches, easier on the pocketbook and a less waste of time for you. The CLEAR Framework Good prompts are CLEAR – a framework developed by Leo Lo, a librarian and professor at the University of New Mexico.
