Artificial Intelligence Explainer
What is ChatGPT and how does it (and similar technologies) work?
It is a large language model (LLM) that is "trained" on a large amount of data and GENERATES statistically probable text.
They DO NOT SEARCH FOR information
This could be correct or incorrect information
It is up to you to use your good judgment about it
They are NOT free from bias
Text from the internet (Wikipedia, public forums, Twitter, Reddit, code documents, etc) gets processed in a neural network
