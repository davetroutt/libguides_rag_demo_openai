of new programs that can “do your writing for you”. Why did I put that into quotes? Because some of the writing is problematic and a lot of it is downright bland. Having said that, I accept that this is yet another way to get around doing your own work, if that is the choice being made. But maybe it can be used for good, and that is where we are right now. In the “what if” and “how to” zone. We might have assignments that use or integrate AI writing this semester. There might be other places where it simply isn't appropriate for the assignment. Perhaps AI can be a helpful tool, and that is part of what we can explore this semester. With that in mind, if you are found to have used AI writing programs in a place where they are not explicitly allowed on an assignment, you will receive a ‘0' grade, be reported for academic dishonesty, and will not have the chance to re-do or replace that assignment. I'd prefer that we see this as a chance to learn and adapt rather than just another way to cheat, so we'll approach it from that angle and see where we end up. I look forward to entering this newish universe with you." << Previous: AI Tools Next: AI Images and Multimedia >> Last Updated: Dec 19, 2024 9:40 AM URL: https://guides.library.ttu.edu/artificialintelligencetools Print Page Login to LibApps Report a problem Subjects: Artificial Intelligence , Computer Science , Engineering Tags: academic integrity , academic writing , ai , ai detection , ai empowerment , ai evasion , artificial intelligence , chatbots , chatgpt , citing ai , deepfake , detection , empowerment , evasion , generative ai , google gemini , gptzero , microsoft copilot Ask a Librarian
